A project to automate the classic Snake game using AI or algorithmic approaches. This repository contains code to train and deploy an automated agent that plays the Snake game efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Gameplay**: The snake navigates autonomously to collect food and avoid collisions.
- **Reinforcement Learning (Optional)**: Integration with RL frameworks (e.g., Q-Learning) for adaptive learning.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Built with Pygame for interactive visualization.
- **High Score Tracking**: Logs high scores and performance metrics.
